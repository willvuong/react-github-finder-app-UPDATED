Version 2 of the original project. The first iteration of the project was written in old react with class based 
components and without the use of hooks. This current version of the project takes user data stored in the Github
API and allows users to filter specific users through their search query where you then access general information 
about the selected user. States are stored and passed through useContext's for easy access to shared states and to 
help with readability. The purpose of the second version of this project was to convert class based and 'hookless' 
components into functional components that pass state and functions through props, then to store those states and 
functions in a context API.
